"""Report dependencies that block Python 3.11+ builds.

The script imports the package metadata defined in ``clpipe.config.package``
and compares the pinned dependency versions with a curated list of the
minimum versions known to provide Python 3.11 wheels (or otherwise document
Python 3.11 compatibility).

Because the repository purposely pins many dependencies, a stale pin can be
an immediate source of ``pip`` resolution failures on Python 3.11+.  Running
this script surfaces those problematic pins so that they can be reviewed and
updated alongside a broader dependency refresh.
